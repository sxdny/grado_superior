## Create these two tables on the Procedure:

### Casting table.

Casting trigger:

````sql
CREATE TRIGGER tr_inr_ishired
AFTER UPDATE ON casting
FOR EACH ROW
--
IF NEW.is_hired = 1 THEN
	INSERT INTO acting
	SELECT * FROM casting
	WHERE is_hired = 1;

````

Trigger function in this table.

| movie_id | character_id | actor_id | expected_salary | casting_order | is_hired | agreed_salary |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | --------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 17       | 3            | 6        | 1.0             | 3             | FALSE    | NULL          |
| 17       | 3            | 11       | 1.5             | 1             | TRUE     |               |
| 17       | 3            | 12       | 3.0             | 2             | FALSE    | NULL          |

### Acting table.

When **is_hired** == 1, insert that actor in actin table:

| movie_Id | character_Id | actor_id | paid_salary |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | ----------- |
| 17       | 3            | 11       | 1.0         |

### Aggregate functions SUM(), COUNT() AVG() combined with the GROUP BY.

**actors_view**
* height, weight, age.
**characters**
* height, weight, age.
**casting**
* expected_salary, negotiated_salary.
**acting**
* payed_salary

[W3Schools | GROUP BY](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp)

The `GROUP BY` statement is often used with aggregate functions (`COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

Average actor_age from VIEW:

````sql
SELECT FLOOR(AVG(actor_age)) AS average_actor_age FROM actors_view
````

> The `GROUP BY` is used like a ==for each==.

Salary difference between expected_salary and agreed-salary:

````sql
SELECT (SUM(expected_salary) - SUM(agreed_salary)) AS salary_difference
FROM casting
GROUP BY actor_id
````

- [ ] Hacer casting view.
- [ ] Hacer el expected_salary del casting_view.

### Casting view.

| movie_id | character_id | actor_id | ==expected_salary== | casting_position | is_hired | agreed_salary |
| -------- | ------------ | -------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 30       | 2            | 11       | 1.5                 | 2                | 0        | NULL          |
| 30       | 2            | 22       | 2.5                 | 1                | 1        | 3.0           |
| 30       | 2            | 28       | 3.0                 | 3                | 0        | NULL          |


La casting_view tiene 4 columnas extras:
- movie_title.
- character_name.
- actor_name.
- expected_salary.

expected_salary:

````sql
SELECT AVG(payed_salary)
FROM acting_view
WHERE actor_id = casting.actor_id
AND released_year >= YEAR(CURRENT_DATE()) - 5
````

### Reservations View.

Total income since the company started (reversations table):

````sql
SELECT SUM(subtotal)
FROM reservations_view;
````

Reservations view:
| reservation_number | customer_id | car_id | date_in    | date_out   | unit_price | subtotal (calculated column) |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1341               | 2           | 8      | 2023-03-02 | 2023-03-05 | 80         | 160                          |

subtotal --> calculated column (qty * price)

Total income in last season between May 1 and Oct 1.

````sql
SELECT SUM(subtotal)
FROM reservations_view
WHERE date_out BETWEEN 2022-05-01 AND 2022-09-30 -- include both days.
````

Total income, **per car**:

````sql
SELECT car_id, SUM(subtotal)
FROM reservations_view
GROUP BY car_id;
````

Total income, **per month**:

````sql
SELECT MONTH(date_out) AS month, SUM(subtotal) AS subtotal
FROM reservations_view
GROUP BY MONTH(date_out);
````

Total income, **per car category:**

==Add car_category to the reservations_view and then do the query:==
| reservation_number | customer_id | car_id | date_in    | date_out   | unit_price | subtotal (calculated column) | car_model |
| ------------------ | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------------------------- | --------- |
| 1341               | 2           | 8      | 2023-03-02 | 2023-03-05 | 80         | 160                          |  Sport |         |

````sql
SELECT car_catagory, SUM (subtotal)
FROM reservations_view
GROUP BY car_category;
````

Total income, **per year:**

````sql
SELECT YEAR(date_out), SUM(subtotal)
FROM reservations_view
GROUP BY YEAR(date_out);
````

**GROUP BY YEAR** and **GROUP BY MONTH**.

### Get cars between 2 dates.

List of available cars between 2 specific dates.

````sql
SELECT *
FROM cars
WHERE car_id NOT IN (SELECT car_id
FROM reservations
WHERE date_in < '2023-03-07' AND date_out > '2023-03-01');
-- Sustituir las dates con variables para hacer una procedure.
````

### For the weekend.
